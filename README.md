# COVID-19 Statistics

## COVID-19 or Coronavirus Disease is a respiratory illness that caused a Global Pandemic.  It was identified in late 2019, and quickly escalated to a Pandemic across multiple countries by early 2020.  The disease spread quickly, infecting millions of people around the globe.  While most infected would experience mild to moderate symptoms, there were many who became seriously ill and died.  Eventually a vaccine was developed and distributed that would help slow the spread of the disease and reduce the death count.  This project shows some of the key statistics surrounding the Death Counts and Percentages using data from February 2020 through May 2021.

### During the analyzed time period, there were over 150 million cases of COVID-19 with a 2.1% Death Rate.  The United States had the highest percent of the population infected of the major countries with a 9.77%, although there were much smaller nations such as Czechia(15.23%) and Slovenia(11.56%) that were higher overall.  The continent with the highest death percentage was South America at 2.70, followed closely by Africa at 2.67.

### Europe had the highest overall death count at just over 1 million, even though it was 4th in death percentage.  The United States of America experienced 576,232 deaths, coming in at the top of the list, followed by Brazil and Mexico.  The US and Europe also had the highest percent of vaccinations given to the population by far.  However, Africa had the lowest percentage of vaccinations given at only 1.33%.  This is most likely the reason why their death percentage rate was higher than other continents.  

###  In future analysis I would take a deeper dive into the relation between vaccination percentage and infection rates.  I also would like to look at specific areas within the country to compare death and vaccination percentage rates, sadly this dataset did not include this information.
