# COVID-19 Statistics

## COVID-19 or Coronavirus Disease is a respiratory illness that caused a Global Pandemic.  It was identified in late 2019, and quickly escalated to a Pandemic across multiple countries by early 2020.  The disease spread quickly, infecting millions of people around the globe.  While most infected would experience mild to moderate symptoms, there were many who became seriously ill and died.  Eventually a vaccine was developed and distributed that would help slow the spread of the disease and reduce the death count.  This project shows some of the key statistics surrounding the Death Counts and Percentages using data from February 2020 through May 2021.
